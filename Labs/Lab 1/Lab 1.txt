I made one iteration around the array to solve the problem, keeping track of previously accessed elements and their indices using a hashmap.
By determining if each indices part already existed on the map, I was able to quickly discover its complement and determine which pair added up to the target.
By using the quick lookup capabilities of a hashmap, the approach optimizes for speed and ensures a linear time solution.
