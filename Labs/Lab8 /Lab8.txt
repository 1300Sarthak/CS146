I first started at zero, where I need no coins, I look at each coin value and update my list with the
new minimum for each amount. If a coin fits into an amount, I see if it gives a smaller number of coins 
than what I had before. If it does I remember that number, and save it. Finally, if the spot for my total 
amount has a real number and not the super large one I started with that's the least coins I need otherwise,
it means I can't make that amount with the coins I have.
