The code I wrote determines if all college courses can be completed given their prerequisites. To solve this I 
first counted the prerequisites for each course, then tackled those without any, progressing to others as their 
prerequisites were fulfilled. My loop keeps track until all courses are processed or until it hit an error with 
unresolved prerequisites. If the processed courses matched the total count, then my code returns True. This signals 
that all courses could be completed. Otherwise, it returns False.
