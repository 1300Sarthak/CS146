First, I check if the two words I'm comparing have the same number of letters, if they don't, they can't be a match.
Next, I use a Hashmap to keep track of each letter's appearances, counting up for the first word and down for the second. 
This method helps me ensure every letter aligns perfectly, letting me confidently identify if the words are rearranged versions of each other.
