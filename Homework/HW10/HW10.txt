The program works the same way, for both Java and Python it works by using a level order traversal on a binary tree. 
Starting at the root, it adds to a queue. In a loop it takes each node from the front of the queue, records its value,
and then if the node has children, it adds them to the queue. This continues until the queue is fully empty. The 
program outputs a list containing the values of the nodes at each level, starting from the root and proceeding level
by level down the tree. This makes sure that all nodes on one level are visited before any nodes on the next.
