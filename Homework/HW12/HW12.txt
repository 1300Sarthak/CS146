To solve this problem, in HW12 of supplying water to all houses within a village using the lowest cost possible,
I started out by using a graph-based approach, treating each house as a node. I presented the option to install a 
well in each house as edges connecting a virtual node to these houses with costs equivalent to the well installation,
and I included the piping costs as edges between houses. I then implemented Kruskal's algorithm which works well for
finding the Minimum Spanning Tree, also known as MST of the graph. It works well by first sorting all the edges, 
including both wells and pipes based on cost and then using a union-find data structure with path compression to 
add edges without forming cycles. This approach, that I have used combines edges until all houses are connected, 
making sure that the total cost is low by always selecting the least expensive available connection.
