We start by counting how many times each character shows up in the string. From this we can understand that 
characters can be paired up to form the two halves that we'll need for the palindrome. Since they are symmetrical,
we can just add up the pairs of characters we have to get the length of our new palindrome, making sure we are using 
all occurrences we need to. Now, on the off chance we have an odd count of characters, we can just place one exactly
in the middle, allowing us to build the longest possible palindrome by maximizing the use of pairs. And, accounting
for a central character if need be.
