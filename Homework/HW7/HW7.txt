To figure out the fewest servers needed for jobs happening at different times, I started by sorting the jobs by 
when they begin and end. This sorting allowed me to check whether a currently finishing job's server could be 
reassigned to a new job starting at that time. By iterating over the sorted start times and comparing them with 
the sorted end times. I was effectively able to track the allocation and freeing up of servers. This method relied 
on the principle that managing resources based on their availability can minimize the total resources required.
