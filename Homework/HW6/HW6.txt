I first started by sorting the input array to arrange the elements in order. We do this to help us later on and 
with identifying duplicate numbers, and making it easier to skip over them. From there with the sorted array, we
fix one number and search for two other numbers that when added together cancel out the fixed number. Getting a sum
of zero. Next, we do this search efficiently by moving two pointers towards each other from opposite ends of the array
moving their positions based on whether the current sum is too low or too high.The final step is going back to skipping of any 
duplicate numbers so we can get our proper solution!
